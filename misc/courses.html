                This course introduces the students to the basics of front-end web development.
                Students learn how to utilize HTML 5 and CSS 3 in order to create web templates.
                Topics include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 5, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 3,
                and an introduction to JavaScript. This course is the foundation for subsequent
                web-development courses.

                ​This course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming and problem solving.
                Students taking this course will design, implement, test, and debug programs that
                incorporate: variables, expressions, assignments, I/O, conditional and iterative
                control constructs, functions, and parameter passing. The course assumes no previous
                programming experience. Students will be assessed through quizzes, assignments, and
                exams.

                ​This course introduces students to discrete mathematics, statistics, and Boolean
                logic, and applies these mathematical constructs to computer program code. The
                purpose of this course is twofold: one, introduce students to math that is
                immediately applicable to their studies and programming for web application
                development; two, demonstrate to students the importance of these facets of math in
                their software development and design studies by allowing students to create
                real-world examples in computer program code that demonstrate the importance of math
                in computer science.
